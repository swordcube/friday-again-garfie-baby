# friday again garfie baby

dumb dipshit fnf engine

very experimental, gonna be used for sword's cubical saturday, which is my (currently unreleased) mod

# üñ•Ô∏è testing guide
if you're seeking to just test the engine, you need to install [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), then open a terminal/cmd in the project root directory and run `love .`

as of right now the latest Love2D release (11.5) won't work with the engine, we are using
version 12.0, which is unreleased, so you have to download an [actions build](https://github.com/love2d/love/actions)

download the latest *successful* build, and find the appropriate version for your OS and architecture (`love-windows-x64` for example)

# üñ•Ô∏è compiling guide

if you're seeking to compile a final release build, uhhh not yet buddy sorry!
