# <img src="./art/icons/16x.png" alt="Friday Night Funkin'" width="24" /> friday again garfie baby

yet another fnf engine, but with a twist!
it's written in LÖVE, it's also slightly themed after garfield because funny

very experimental, gonna be used for sword's cubical saturday, which is my (currently unreleased) mod

> [!NOTE]  
> This only works for LÖVE 12.0 and above, you can download it from the main [LÖVE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/love2d/love) [Actions](https://github.com/love2d/love/actions).
> 
> Download the latest *successful* build, and find the appropriate version for your OS and architecture (`love-windows-x64` for example)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To clone this repo, use the following command:
> ```bat
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/swordcube/friday-again-garfie-baby
> ```
> Otherwise LÖVE will most likely have trouble opening the project!

# 🖥️ testing guide
if you're seeking to just test the engine, you need to install LÖVE first, then open a terminal/cmd in the project root directory and run `love .`

# 🖥️ compiling guide
if you're seeking to compile a final release build, uhhh not yet buddy sorry!

# ❗ quick note about suggesting features
you are free to suggest features in the [issues tab](https://github.com/swordcube/friday-again-garfie-baby/issues), but i'm not going to add absolutely everything that's requested, because i'm not necessarily trying to make the next psych or the next codename or anything like that

# ❓ compatibility with the legacy version
no
